## A bit about me
I fell in love with programming after taking a programming class in college while I was doing the pre-med program. After 1 class, I became obsessed. I switched majors the next semester and never looked back. Since then I've spent 10+ hours a day learning everything I can about the web and software engineering. I love the challenges and problems that can be solved with code. Its incredibly stimulating for me. I spend much of my free time trying out new technologies, working on side projects and reading. Outside of programming, my field of interest is wide; I pick up a new hobby every 6 months or so. I love reading (philosophy, science, history), Lake Powell, yard games and spending time with family and friends. I consider myself an ambivert: I'm recharged by conversation and collaboration, but I'm also a blissful loner on occasion. 

## Work Experience
5+ years of professional programming experience, mainly as a backend/web services engineer. In that time I've also started a couple of businesses, been a teacher and tech coach, and a scrum product owner.
